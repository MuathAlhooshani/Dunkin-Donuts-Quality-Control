### Dunkin Donuts Quality Control
Capstone Project for the Quality Control course in KFUPM (ISE 320)

### Description
This report monitored the service quality of Dunkin Donuts using the appropriate SPC tools. The process of serving coffee for Dunkin Donuts was studied and an appropriate fishbone diagram and OCAP for the process were designed.

The main quality charachteristic monitered was ‘the time Dunkin Donuts takes to serve one coffee to one customer’. The data in timeToServe.csv was collected in the KFUPM Dunkin Donut branch between the hours 8 and 10 am of a business day.

Due to the nature of the quality characteristic, an individual chart with the moving range chart were chosen to be conducted. The calculations and graphing of the aforementioned charts were done via python and the findings show that the process is in control
